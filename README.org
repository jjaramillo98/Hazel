#+TITLE: README

* Introduction
Hazel is lightweight, client-go based Kubernetes utility for monitoring and filtering logs from pods.

* Requirements
- [[https://go.dev/doc/install][Go]] 1.20+
- [[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/][kubectl]] 1.25+

* Usage
Ensure that you have your cluster context correctly set up in your kubeconfig file.

From there you can run the following command to start Hazel:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go run . --namespace <namespace> --service <serviceName>
#+END_SRC

This will start Hazel and begin streaming logs from the specified service.

** Adding to PATH
If you would like to add Hazel to your PATH, you can run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go build -o bin/hazel.exe
#+END_SRC

From there you can add the path to the =bin= directory to your PATH variable.
Restart your terminal and you should be able to run =hazel= from anywhere.
